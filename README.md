# Computational Geometry üìê

Welcome to our GitHub repository dedicated to the subject of **Computational Geometry**. This repository contains various projects and practical exercises related to the field of algorithmic geometry, where we explore and implement fundamental geometric algorithms.

## Overview of Computational Geometry
Computational geometry is a branch of computer science dedicated to the study of algorithms that can be stated in terms of geometry. Some typical problems include computing convex hulls, triangulation of polygons, and point location. These problems have applications in many fields, including computer graphics, robotics, geographical information systems (GIS), and CAD (Computer-Aided Design).

## Repository Content
This repository currently contains the following project:

- **TP1 - Convex Hull using Graham's Scan Algorithm**: A practical exercise to implement the Graham scan algorithm for computing the convex hull of a set of points.

As we progress, we will add more projects that explore different geometric algorithms.

## Technologies
Our projects are primarily implemented in **Python**. The following tools and libraries are used:
- `math` for geometric calculations.
- `matplotlib` for visualizing points and the resulting convex hulls.
